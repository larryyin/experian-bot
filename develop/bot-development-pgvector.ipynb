While Experian may not be able to prevent criminals from stealing your identity, we can help you prevent use of your stolen identity to open new accounts and can help you recover from fraud that results from identity theft.How Experian Works to Help Prevent Credit FraudChecking for inconsistencies: When a lender requests a credit report as a result of an application for credit, Experian automatically checks the information for warning signs of fraud, such as an address or Social Security number that doesn't match the consumer's existing records.Identifying potential fraud activity: Experian also uses a national fraud database that connects known fraud instances and notifies lenders of potential fraud before it occurs.How Experian Helps Victims of Identity TheftExperian offers the following options and assistance to help consumers recover from credit fraud and identity theft:Fraud alerts: There are several fraud alerts, or security alerts, available for consumers to add to their credit reports. When you request a fraud alert, Experian will automatically share your request with the other two major consumer credit reporting agencies.Initial alert: Consumers who are aware that their information may have been compromised, because a wallet was stolen or they received a security breach notice, may wish to add an initial security alert to their credit report.\", metadata={'source': 'n.com blogs ask experian how does experian help victims of identity theft', 'row': 11287}),\n",

This score measures the likelihood that they will repay what they owe and is used by lenders to assess risk, before they lend. The credit report data comes from our Credit Services business line, so a person can see what lenders see about them. Using our interactive tools, they can then routinely monitor their credit and identify ways to improve their credit score. People may also use their credit status for a one-off event, such as negotiating the best deal for a large credit-dependent purchase, like a car. Our identity protection services provide people with identity theft detection, protection and fraud resolution. We monitor the information in a person's credit report and let them know about changes that might be identity fraud. In the event of fraud, we give people access to a dedicated fraud resolution service, together with insurance against financial loss. We also help parents to monitor their children's online activity, with our Safetyweb.com\\xa0services. Our DataPatrol product provides real-time web and social network monitoring, to help prevent identity fraud before it happens. We currently offer credit reports and scores in the US through\\xa0Experian.com,\\xa0CreditReport.com\\xa0and\\xa0freecreditscore.com, and through\\xa0CreditExpert.co.uk\\xa0in the UK.\", metadata={'source': 'n.com corporate experian interactive', 'row': 13344}),\n",

      "If your company finances purchases of vehicles through loans, you need to not only check on the individual’s credit history, but also have full information about the risk of using the vehicle to secure the loan. Even a quote for insurance on a vehicle requires disclosure of the vehicle’s details. Experian® can help you: Confirm the identity of a vehicle – with more than 7 billion records held on vehicles in the United States, Experian can help you obtain specific details for a vehicle, such as make, model, color and dimensions. We also can help with more complex or industry-specific information, such as comparing the cost to a possible replacement or ensuring you have knowledge of the right finance, loans or insurance agreements for the vehicle. Minimize the risk of purchasing a problem vehicle – a used car may have issues that are not evident just by looking at it on the surface. These issues can have a significant impact on the value of the vehicle. We can tell you whether the vehicle: Has ever been reported as stolen Was ever involved in a serious car accident Has undergone a change in registration or license plate Is recorded as being imported or exported property Has an anomaly with the mileage record Provide peace of mind and governance when selling the vehicle – Experian is approved by manufacturers and brands and works closely with regulators to be able to provide an independent check and follow due diligence to meet the expectations of a used-vehicle purchaser. Confirm what parts or services can be used for that vehicle – we hold industry-standard codes and data assets that allow your vehicle to be linked to its proprietary information, linking you to parts files and specifications to make sure the correct components are ordered for a vehicle and fitted as the vehicle requires.
